# BudgetRKV2Extractor
A shitty, quickly written project for exporting RKV2 files from Ty 2 and Ty 3

# Current Issues
- Does not preserve directory structure
- Not very user friendly or modular

# Usage
`BudgetRKV2Extract "/path/to/the/rkv/file.rkv" "/output/directory/"`

**The ending '/' is required for the second path or it will make an absolute disaster in your folders. You have been warned!**
